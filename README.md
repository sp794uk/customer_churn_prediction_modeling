When a customer terminates their relationship with a company, this is referred to as customer churn. It is one of the most important concerns for businesses because of its direct impact on revenue. The goal of this project is to implement and compare the performance of differentÂ churn prediction models. The performance of selected models is evaluated using standard performance measures on a public dataset of customers in a telecom company.
