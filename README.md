## Abstract: 
When a customer terminates their relationship with a company, this is referred to as customer churn. It is one of the most important concerns for businesses because of its direct impact on revenue. The goal of this project is to implement and compare the performance of different churn prediction models. The performance of selected models is evaluated using standard performance measures on a public dataset of customers in a telecom company.

## Contextualization: 
Nowadays, the products offered by various businesses are often indistinguishable. As a result, more businesses are shifting from a product-driven to a customer-driven approach [1].

As per [2], Companies place a high value on reducing customer churn because it has a direct impact on revenue and increasing customer retention has proven to be the most profitable strategy for increasing revenue. Retaining an existing customer is much less expensive than acquiring a new one [3]. Furthermore, this is thought to be easier than upselling [4]. Thus, effectively predicting customers who are likely to churn represents a potentially large additional revenue source if done early [3].

Organizations typically use CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems [5] to help acquire, maintain, and retain customers for maximum profitability. These systems nowadays include churn prediction modelling system, which typically use business intelligence and analytical methods to analyse customers' personal, demographic, and behavioural data automatically.

Customer churn prediction models are designed to predict which customers are about to churn and to allow organisations to target the customers who are most likely to churn with a retention campaign. This allows for more efficient use of limited marketing budgets to reduce churn, thereby increasing the return on marketing investment [6].

This study compares well-known classification techniques with the goal of further investigating this using a variety of datasets, metrics, and algorithms in the future.

## Motivation
1. It is now widely accepted that acquiring a new customer costs approximately five times more than retaining an existing one (Reichheld, 1996) [7].
2. Returning a dissatisfied customer costs ten times as much as keeping an existing one (Marcus C., 1998). Long-term customers are also more profitable, less sensitive to competitive marketing activities, less expensive to serve, and may generate new referrals through positive word-of-mouth, whereas dissatisfied customers may spread negative word-of-mouth [8].
3. According to studies conducted across a variety of industries, a five-point increase in customer retention can increase profits by more than 25-95% [9]. On the other hand, losing customers results in lost sales opportunities [10].
4. Customers' requirements are constantly changing. As a result, it is critical for businesses to be aware of and respond to these changes at all times. If a company fails to respond in a timely manner, it risks losing key customers.
5. Saran Kumar A., Chandrakala D., in ‘A Survey on Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques, International Journal of Computer Applications, 10 Nov 2016’, have concluded that all of the churn prediction models have low accuracy and prediction. Hence a good prediction model is required in order to avoid the customer churn problem.
6. Even a small improvement in customer retention may yield significant returns [11] for organizations.

## Project Aims:
The project's goal is to research, test, and compare various machine learning algorithms for predicting customer churn using our dataset. In this report, we look at models generated by KNN, Logistic Regression, and XGBOOST.

In the future, custom revenue metrics could be included into this model to contextualise the efficacy of applied algorithms. Moreover, we hope to test the performance of our model with more varied datasets and algorithms.
